# ML - Neural Network - Parkinsons Speach data analysis
Analysis of Parkinson’s speech data using a neural network to predict positive Parkinson’s diagnosis.

The code in Neural Net Expereiment.py was used to run experiment with 10 trails to identify the optimal parameters for a Neural Net predicting positive Parkinson’s diagnosis from speech data. The code in best_model.py runs the optimal model as per the experiment results.
